# 📍 Level2-Project — Interactive Services Platform + Contact/Feedback System

## 📍Step 1: Idea & Project Overview

### 💡 Idea
**Interactive Services Platform + Contact/Feedback System**  
A clean and modern website showcasing services or products interactively, with a contact form for visitors to get in touch. The form will be processed using basic PHP.

- Includes **dynamic filtering** for services (e.g., All, Web, Mobile...).  
- **Testimonials Slider** section to showcase client feedback.  
- **About Us** section to introduce the business.  
- **Contact Us** section with an embedded map and a contact form.  
- **Basic PHP Back-End** to process form submissions and return a success/error message.

### 🎯 Goals
1. Improve UI/UX design skills for professional interfaces.  
2. Implement **JavaScript ES6+** for DOM manipulation and event handling.  
3. Practice **Basic PHP** for handling form data (Form Handling).  
4. Organize files and folders using a professional structure.  
5. Apply **Responsive Design** for all screen sizes.  
6. Follow **Code Architecture & Standards** (OOP/SOLID/Design Patterns if applicable).

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Front-End:** HTML5, CSS3/SASS, JavaScript ES6+  
- **Back-End:** PHP (Basic)  
- **Styling:** CSS Flexbox & Grid, Animations, Media Queries

### 🧠 Code Architecture & Standards
- Apply **OOP Principles** in JavaScript if needed (e.g., for slider management).  
- Follow **SOLID Principles** where applicable.  
- Use **Design Patterns** if relevant (e.g., Factory Pattern for service cards).  
- Keep code **modular and reusable**.  
- Ensure **easy maintainability** for future updates.  

---

### 🌐 Environment Selection
- **XAMPP** will be used for local development since PHP is required for the contact form.  

---

### 📊 Performance & Accessibility Targets
- **Performance Budget:** Keep load time < 2.5s on standard broadband.  
- **Accessibility (A11y):** Ensure proper alt tags, ARIA roles, and keyboard navigation.  
- **Responsive Testing:** Check across real devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).  

---

### 📌 SEO Considerations
- Semantic HTML structure.  
- Meta tags for title, description, and keywords.  
- Open Graph tags for social media previews.
