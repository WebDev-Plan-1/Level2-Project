And if you don\u2019t find my jokes funny, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m a software developer, not a comedian.\r\n\r\nFirst things first: let me introduce myself. My name is Franklin Osei, and I\u2019m a Software Developer. I\u2019m passionate about Software Engineering, and I\u2019m always looking for new ways to learn and grow in my field.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m writing these blogs as a way to share my experiences and insights with others. I believe that blogging is a great way to connect with like-minded people, share ideas, and inspire others. Plus, it\u2019s a great way to improve my writing skills and express my creativity.\r\n\r\nNow, I have to admit that I\u2019m a bit nervous about starting this blog. It\u2019s a big step for me, and I\u2019m still learning the ropes. But I\u2019m also excited about the possibilities. I can\u2019t wait to start sharing my knowledge, experiences, and insights with you all.\r\n\r\nWhat to expect?\r\nSo, what can you expect from this blog? Well, I plan to write about a wide range of topics related to Software Engineering. I\u2019ll share my thoughts on industry trends, discuss the latest tools and technologies, and share tips and advice based on my own experiences.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll also share my personal journey and the challenges I\u2019ve faced along the way. I hope that by sharing my experiences, I can inspire others to pursue their passions and achieve their goals.\r\n\r\nIn short, I\u2019m here to share my story, my ideas, and my passion with you all. I hope that you\u2019ll join me on this journey, and I promise to make it worth your while. So, keep an eye out for exciting content from me in the coming weeks and months!\r\n\r\nThank you for reading, and I look forward to connecting with you all soon.",

        "content": "Watching a programme on television recently about a day in the life of a busy Accident and Emergency department, I am moved to tears by the heartfelt and earnest opening remarks of an A and E consultant:\r\n\r\n\u2026tell your loved ones how much they mean to you because you never know what is going to happen to you that means you never get the chance again.\u201d\r\n\r\nThese are stark, emotionally charged words from someone who has witnessed the loss and grief of sudden tragic life-changing events all too often. \r\n\r\nTell them you love them.\r\nOur family has lived experience of this, with the sudden shocking death of a close family member only a few years ago. \r\n\r\nNo chance to say goodbye, no final words. No chance to receive their final wisdom or how-to-live-without-me thoughts. \r\n\r\nI have been musing here recently on death bed regrets. You can read more on that here.\r\n\r\nAnd this is another common one:\r\n\r\nWishing we had told others more often that we love them. \r\nWe all like to be appreciated, and if we are honest, sometimes our focus in a relationship can be receiving love and not on as much on giving it. \r\n\r\nEqually, with busy and full lives, we don\u2019t always take the time to communicate directly and specifically to those closest to us that we love them. We know in our heads that we are loved by those around us, and that we love and value them. \r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the thing though:\r\n\r\nHow often do we actually say it out loud?\r\nTo them. To their face. \r\n\r\nI know, I know, this is not a very Scottish thing to do at all. But like all things, it gets easier with practice.\r\n\r\nTaking those we love for granted erodes the joy in those relationships. And we risk running out of chances. I know that sounds morbid and doom-filled, but that is the reality of life. And we are not very good at talking about death. I have been to more funerals in the last few years than in all my combined years before that. Parents of friends, friends, and the heartbreaking funeral of the child of a friend. \r\n\r\nLife happens.",

New York City undoubtedly tops the list as the nation's largest city (8.5 million residents) and one of the world's great fashion, culture and finance capitals. Los Angeles comes in just behind, the US's second-most populous city and the centre of the film industry, gateway to beaches and laid-back lifestyles. The third-largest city, Chicago, was home to the world's first skyscraper and has long vied with New York in a race to build the world's tallest, most impressive buildings.\r\n\r\nWith the top three seemingly fixed, one question recently set social media aflame: what city deserves the US's fourth spot? Residents from across the country made their case, but a few consistently rose to the top \u2013 whether by population, tourism or historical importance. We asked locals what makes their city worthy of the title and why tourists should add it to their itineraries.\r\n\r\nThis centre of federal power was purposefully built to be separate from the states and serve as the nation's capital. Named after the first president, the city sits alongside the Potomac River and still reflects its early design by Peter Charles L'Enfant, anchored by The National Mall \u2013 the central stretch of federal buildings that includes Congress, Smithsonian museums and many of the US's most famous national memorials.",
