        "category": "Life-Coaching",
        "content": "Watching a programme on television recently about a day in the life of a busy Accident and Emergency department, I am moved to tears by the heartfelt and earnest opening remarks of an A and E consultant:\r\n\r\n…tell your loved ones how much they mean to you because you never know what is going to happen to you that means you never get the chance again.”\r\n\r\nThese are stark, emotionally charged words from someone who has witnessed the loss and grief of sudden tragic life-changing events all too often. \r\n\r\nTell them you love them.\r\nOur family has lived experience of this, with the sudden shocking death of a close family member only a few years ago. \r\n\r\nNo chance to say goodbye, no final words. No chance to receive their final wisdom or how-to-live-without-me thoughts. \r\n\r\nI have been musing here recently on death bed regrets. You can read more on that here.\r\n\r\nAnd this is another common one:\r\n\r\nWishing we had told others more often that we love them. \r\nWe all like to be appreciated, and if we are honest, sometimes our focus in a relationship can be receiving love and not on as much on giving it. \r\n\r\nEqually, with busy and full lives, we don’t always take the time to communicate directly and specifically to those closest to us that we love them. We know in our heads that we are loved by those around us, and that we love and value them. \r\n\r\nHere’s the thing though:\r\n\r\nHow often do we actually say it out loud?\r\nTo them. To their face. \r\n\r\nI know, I know, this is not a very Scottish thing to do at all. But like all things, it gets easier with practice.\r\n\r\nTaking those we love for granted erodes the joy in those relationships. And we risk running out of chances. I know that sounds morbid and doom-filled, but that is the reality of life. And we are not very good at talking about death. I have been to more funerals in the last few years than in all my combined years before that. Parents of friends, friends, and the heartbreaking funeral of the child of a friend. \r\n\r\nLife happens.",

New York City undoubtedly tops the list as the nation's largest city (8.5 million residents) and one of the world's great fashion, culture and finance capitals. Los Angeles comes in just behind, the US's second-most populous city and the centre of the film industry, gateway to beaches and laid-back lifestyles. The third-largest city, Chicago, was home to the world's first skyscraper and has long vied with New York in a race to build the world's tallest, most impressive buildings.\r\n\r\nWith the top three seemingly fixed, one question recently set social media aflame: what city deserves the US's fourth spot? Residents from across the country made their case, but a few consistently rose to the top – whether by population, tourism or historical importance. We asked locals what makes their city worthy of the title and why tourists should add it to their itineraries.\r\n\r\nThis centre of federal power was purposefully built to be separate from the states and serve as the nation's capital. Named after the first president, the city sits alongside the Potomac River and still reflects its early design by Peter Charles L'Enfant, anchored by The National Mall – the central stretch of federal buildings that includes Congress, Smithsonian museums and many of the US's most famous national memorials.",

        "title": "Positive Parenting for Children",
        "category": "Life-Coaching",
        "content": "Parents have an important job. Raising kids is both rewarding and challenging. You’re likely to get a lot of advice along the way, from doctors, family, friends, and even strangers. But every parent and child is unique. Being sensitive and responsive to your kids can help you build positive, healthy relationships together.\r\n“Being a sensitive parent and responding to your kids cuts across all areas of parenting,” says Arizona State University’s Dr. Keith Crnic, a parent-child relationship expert. “What it means is recognizing what your child needs in the moment and providing that in an effective way.”\r\nThis can be especially critical for infants and toddlers, he adds. Strong emotional bonds often develop through sensitive, responsive, and consistent parenting in the first years of life. For instance, holding your baby lovingly and responding to their cries helps build strong bonds.\r\nBuilding Bonds\r\nStrong emotional bonds help children learn how to manage their own feelings and behaviors and develop self-confidence. They help create a safe base from which they can explore, learn, and relate to others.\r\n\r\nExperts call this type of strong connection between children and their caregivers “secure attachment.” Securely attached children are more likely to be able to cope with challenges like poverty, family instability, parental stress, and depression.\r\n\r\nA recent analysis shows that about 6 out of 10 children in the U.S. develop secure attachments to their parents. The 4 out of 10 kids who lack such bonds may avoid their parents when they are upset or resist their parents if they cause them more distress. Studies suggest that this can make kids more prone to serious behavior problems. Researchers have been testing programs to help parents develop behaviors that encourage secure attachment.\r\n\r\nBeing Available\r\nModern life is full of things that can influence your ability to be sensitive and responsive to your child. These include competing priorities, extra work, lack of sleep, and things like mobile devices. Some experts are concerned about the effects that distracted parenting may have on emotional bonding and children’s language development, social interaction, and safety.\r\n\r\nIf parents are inconsistently available, kids can get distressed and feel hurt, rejected, or ignored. They may have more emotional outbursts and feel alone. They may even stop trying to compete for their parent’s attention and start to lose emotional connections to their parents.\r\n\r\n“There are times when kids really do need your attention and want your recognition,” Crnic explains. Parents need to communicate that their kids are valuable and important, and children need to know that parents care what they’re doing, he says.\r\n\r\nIt can be tough to respond with sensitivity during tantrums, arguments, or other challenging times with your kids. “If parents respond by being irritable or aggressive themselves, children can mimic that behavior, and a negative cycle then continues to escalate,” explains Dr. Carol Metzler, who studies parenting at the Oregon Research Institute.\r\n\r\nAccording to Crnic, kids start to regulate their own emotions and behavior around age three. Up until then, they depend more on you to help them regulate their emotions, whether to calm them or help get them excited. “They’re watching you to see how you do it and listening to how you talk to them about it,” he explains. “Parents need to be good self-regulators. You’re not only trying to regulate your own emotions in the moment, but helping your child learn to manage their emotions and behavior.”\r\n\r\nAs kids become better at managing their feelings and behavior, it’s important to help them develop coping skills, like active problem solving. Such skills can help them feel confident in handling what comes their way.\r\n\r\n“When parents engage positively with their children, teaching them the behaviors and skills that they need to cope with the world, children learn to follow rules and regulate their own feelings,” Metzler says.\r\n\r\n“As parents, we try really hard to protect our kids from the experience of bad things,” Crnic explains. “But if you protect them all the time and they are not in situations where they deal with difficult or adverse circumstances, they aren’t able to develop healthy coping skills.”\r\n\r\nHe encourages you to allow your kids to have more of those experiences and then help them learn how to solve the problems that emerge. Talk through the situation and their feelings. Then work with them to find solutions to put into practice. \r\n\r\nMeeting Needs\r\nAs children grow up, it’s important to remember that giving them what they need doesn’t mean giving them everything they want. “These two things are very different,” Crnic explains. “Really hone in on exactly what’s going on with your kid in the moment. This is an incredibly important parenting skill and it’s linked to so many great outcomes for kids.”\r\n\r\nThink about where a child is in life and what skills they need to learn at that time. Perhaps they need help managing emotions, learning how to behave in a certain situation, thinking through a new task, or relating to friends.\r\n\r\n“You want to help kids become confident,” Crnic says. “You don’t want to aim too high where they can’t get there or too low where they have already mastered the skill.” Another way to boost confidence while strengthening your relationship is to let your kid take the lead.\r\n\r\n“Make some time to spend with your child that isn’t highly directive, where your child leads the play,” advises Dr. John Bates, who studies children’s behavior problems at Indiana University Bloomington. “Kids come to expect it and they love it, and it really improves the relationship.”\r\n\r\nBates also encourages parents to focus on their child’s actual needs instead of sticking to any specific parenting principles.\r\n\r\nIt’s never too late to start building a healthier, more positive relationship with your child, even if things have gotten strained and stressful. “Most importantly, make sure that your child knows that you love them and are on their side,” Metzler says. “For older children, let them know that you are genuinely committed to building a stronger relationship with them and helping them be successful.”\r\n\r\nBy being a sensitive and responsive parent, you can help set your kids on a positive path, teach them self-control, reduce the likelihood of troublesome behaviors, and build a warm, caring parent-child relationship.",
